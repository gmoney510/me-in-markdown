## Introduction
Hey! My name is Giuliana Militello. I am in 10th grade right now and I play soccer for the Chstsworth varsity team and club soccer outside of school. My favorite book I have read is Do Not Disturb. I started to read it because my 9th grade english teacher told me that it was really good and a lot of my friends have read it. A personal achivement that I have is getting all A's all throughout school and paking the varsity soccer team as a freshman. 

My goals for the school year are to get straight A's, pass my AP tests, and do well in soccer. During summer I went to Miami and Mexico and while I was there I  relaxed in the resort the whole time. My favorite food is burgers because you can never go wrong with them and they are a comfort food. 

One act of voulenteer work I have done is help kids with disabilies play soccer. This summer I did many things with me friends. My favorite things we did was when we went shopping all together and also when we went to the pool and took pictures while we were there. In the future, I would like to go to UCLA or USC to geth into the medical feild to become a doctor.
