## Introduction
Hey! My name is Giuliana Militello. I am in 10th grade right now and I play soccer for the Chstsworth varsity team and club soccer outside of school. My favorite book I have read is Do Not Disturb. I started to read it because my 9th grade english teacher told me that it was really good and a lot of my friends have read it. A personal achivement that I have is getting all A's all throughout school and paking the varsity soccer team as a freshman. 

Some goals I have for the school year are getting all A's, passing all of my AP tests, and doing well in soccer. During summer, I went to Miami and Mexico. While I was in both of those places I just relaxed and stayed at the resort. My favorite food to eat are burgers because it is just a comfort food. I hope to learn how to code better and understandy the coding language better.

Some volenteer work I have done was when I helped kids with disabilities play soccer. Over summer I hung out with my friends a lot. My favirot thing I did with them was go shopping and go swimming all together and while we were swimming we took photos as a group. In the future I would like to go to UCLA or USC to go into the medical to become some kind of doctor.
