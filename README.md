## Introduction
Hey! My name is Giuliana Militello. I am in 10th grade right now and I play soccer for the Chstsworth varsity team and club soccer outside of school. My favorite book I have read is Do Not Disturb. I started to read it because my 9th grade english teacher told me that it was really good and a lot of my friends have read it. A personal achivement that I have is getting all A's all throughout school and paking the varsity soccer team as a freshman.
